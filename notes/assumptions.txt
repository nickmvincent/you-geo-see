This code assumes some facts about Google search for convenience.
In other words, anything stated in "assumptions" is not explicitly checked and therefore should be validated by a human when interpreting results.

Eventually, it would be ideal to incorporate an automated method of verifying these assumptions, because the search platform could change at any moment.

1. When Google Maps results are returned on a page, they are ALWAYS first. Therefore, maps results do not have a "Rank" - they are "Rank 0", overpowering other ranked results.
^^ This is not true. We need to update code to account for this issue.
NMV 9/9/2018: upon inspecting DB, this is fixed. MapsLocations are ranked, e.g. they might be rank 5 on the page.

2. There will at most be one "Tweet carousel" per page, and it will appear on the first page.


Analysis only includes the top three Tweets.
But the distribution of tweets from qual_code.py includes all tweets, which would include those w/ rank 4 or 5.
