In addition to providing automated processing of key components of the SERP (e.g. the links, their position, and their destination) our software is also designed to save the raw HTML of the SERPs. This allowed for more detailed human verficiation, i.e. we make sure that the representation of each SERP in the database matches how a human interprets the SERP. This is an important feature, as there is no guarantee that SERPs will keep the same content format or styles, which the software uses to distinguish different types of results. Therefore, it is important that human validation is performed when exploring new queries or after substantial time has passed, even after the software has been extensively validated for other queries.‚Äù
